You are given the digits 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.
You may add '+' and '-' operations inbetween any of the digits.
You may also join digits together to form a bigger number.
The digits must stay in the original order however.
Your aim is to do this in such a way that the result of the equation
is a number that the user provides. Create a program which will ask
the user for a number then find every possible solution.

Here is an example that results in 50:

1 - 2 + 34 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 - 9 = 50
